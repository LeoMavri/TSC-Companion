# TSC Companion NEXT

This is the _next_ version of the TSC Companion script. It's a significant rewrite of the original script, with a lot of new features and improvements.

The style is somewhat inconsistent, but I'm pushing this out to:

1. Get feedback on the new features
2. Lessen the strain on the backend server as this is _a lot_ more efficient than the original script

## How-to

1. Install Greasemonkey or Tampermonkey (or any other userscript manager, however Tampermonkey is recommended)
2. Install the script by clicking [here](https://github.com/LeoMavri/TSC-Companion/raw/next/dist/tsc-companion.user.js)
3. Go to your own profile page and expand the settings menu
4. Fill in your API key (_that you singed up to TSC with_) and turn on the features you want to use
5. Profit :P
